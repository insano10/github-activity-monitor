port over angular app
- copy over CSS
- copy over other images
- overwrite index.html.scala with observation deck index.html
- ensure localhost:9000 goes to observation deck app

port over scala backend
- create placeholder endpoints for the angular app to call
- copy over rest of code to serve up API responses
- parameterise config file
- parameterise index.html.scala with appropriate hostname read from config


cleanup
- delete old angular app
- delete old scala backend
- check all dependencies and config files

should the app (payg/sme) be an api parameter? i.e. one application to serve both dashboards?
