port over angular app
- done!

port over scala backend
- create placeholder endpoints for the angular app to call
- copy over rest of code to serve up API responses
- parameterise config file
- parameterise index.html.scala with appropriate hostname read from config


cleanup
- organise scala classes better
- delete old angular app
- delete old scala backend
- check all dependencies and config files

should the app (payg/sme) be an api parameter? i.e. one application to serve both dashboards?
